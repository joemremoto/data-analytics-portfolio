It also has the widest interquartile range, suggesting significant variability in revenue. The inner fences extend from 120 to 250 USD with no outliers. Email has a median revenue close to 100 USD. It has a narrower IQR which indicates less variability than Email + Call. There are numerous outliers exceeding the upper boundary which indicates that several transactions resulted in higher revenue. The median revenue of Call is around 50 USD, showing that transactions using this method generally generate lower revenue compared to other methods. It also has the smallest spread.

    "- Percentage of customers approached by method\n",

    "- Based on the revenue trends, focusing on the Email + Call method could yield higher returns. The Call method should be forgone since it is the least effective in generating revenue while requiring the most resources. The Email method should be maintained since it requires almost no effort.\n",
    "- Use key metrics to monitor revenue growth or decay and ensure that the percentage of Email + Call increases while Call drops.\n",
    "- Improve data collection, especially in the revenue column. Minimize missing values."
