# Pivot Tables
In this project, I downloaded a global bike sales dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadiqshah/bike-store-sales-in-europe/notebook.
The original csv file looks like this:

Using this data, I inserted a pivot table in another sheet where I grouped the data by country then state. I then assigned the values to Revenue, Cost, and Profit. I also filtered by Customer_Gender to gauge whether the Female or Male paid more money.

I also inserted a calculated field to get the calculated sum of profit (revenue - cost) and compare it with the data from the csv file. The image below shows that
the values are the same.
